# YahooFinance::Scraper

Scrape most active stocks, detailed stock quotes, historical prices, and
options chain prices from Yahoo Finance with ruby. Use it with Tor so Yahoo

        :volume => 10841000,
        :date => 2012-05-02 00:00:00 -0700 },
      ... ]

Get current options chain:

    # Get the current options chain
    YahooFinance::Scraper::Company.new('yhoo').options_chain

returns:

    # note that you can extract the symbol, expiry, put/call, and strike
    # from the option symbol string.
    [ { "YHOO120519C00009000" =>
        { :last => 6.1,
          :change => 0.0,
          :bid => 0.0,
          :ask => 0.0,
          :volume => 5.0,
          :open_int => 5.0,
          :strike => 9.0,
          :expires_at => 2012-05-19 00:00:00 -0700 } },
     { "YHOO120519C00010000" =>
        { :last => 5.7,
          :change => 0.0,
          :bid => 0.0,
          :ask => 0.0,
          :volume => 20.0,
          :open_int => 107.0,
          :strike => 10.0,
          :expires_at => 2012-05-19 00:00:00 -0700 } },
     ... ]

Get the day's actives, % gainers, and % losers:

    YahooFinance::Scraper::Actives.new.actives # or #gainers or #losers

returns:

    [ { :symbol => "FOSL", :name => "Fossil, Inc." },
      { :symbol => "MAKO", :name => "MAKO Surgical Corp." },
      { :symbol => "MRGE", :name => "Merge Healthcare Incorporated." },
      ... ]

You can also control how the http GET happens. Just instantiate with a
getter that implements a `get` method that takes a single string argument
and returns the body of the request as a string.

    class CustomGetter
      def get url
        # get the url and return its contents as a string
      end
    end

    YahooFinance::Scraper::Company.new('yhoo', getter: CustomGetter.new)
    YahooFinance::Scraper::Actives.new(getter: CustomGetter.new)

Why have a custom getter? Because maybe you want to proxy via Tor so you
don't get cut off for making lots of requests. See
[Tor::Proxy](http://github.com/huned/tor_proxy) for a helpful gem.
